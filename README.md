# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

**Note on 502 Errors in Development:** You might occasionally see `502 (Bad Gateway)` errors for requests like `/` or `/favicon.ico` in the browser console during development. These are often related to the development server or proxy setup within the IDE environment and may not indicate an issue with the application code itself. If the application generally loads and functions, these can sometimes be ignored. Persistent 502 errors might require restarting the development server or checking the environment configuration.
